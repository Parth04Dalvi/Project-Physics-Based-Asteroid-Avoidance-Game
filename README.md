üöÄ Asteroid Avoidance GameA classic-style arcade game built entirely with Vanilla JavaScript and the HTML Canvas API, featuring physics-based movement and collision detection. This project demonstrates core web game development concepts within a single HTML file for simplicity and portability.‚ú® FeaturesPhysics Simulation: Implements a custom Vector class and applies thrust, rotation, and dampening (friction) for realistic space movement.Canvas Rendering: Utilizes the HTML5 Canvas API for all game visuals (ship and asteroids).Fixed Timestep Logic: Uses a fixed timestep (1/60th of a second) for consistent physics and game updates, separate from rendering frequency.Object-Oriented Structure: Organizes game logic using JavaScript classes for Vector, Entity, Ship, Asteroid, and the main Game controller.Responsive Design: The game canvas is designed to scale dynamically within its container.Modern Styling: Styled with a dark, space-themed aesthetic using Tailwind CSS (via CDN) and the Space Mono font.‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to PlayInstallationSince the entire game is contained in a single HTML file, there's no complex setup required!Save the Code: Save the provided code snippet as an HTML file (e.g., index.html).Open in Browser: Double-click the saved file to open it directly in any modern web browser.ControlsActionKeyThrust (Accelerate)W or Up ArrowRotate LeftA or Left ArrowRotate RightD or Right ArrowGoalThe objective is to avoid colliding with the asteroids for as long as possible. Your score increases every fraction of a second you survive, and the asteroids speed up over time to increase the challenge!üõ†Ô∏è Technology StackHTML5: StructureVanilla JavaScript (ES6+): Core game logic, physics, and state management.HTML Canvas API: Rendering the game world.Tailwind CSS (CDN): Utility-first styling for the game container, controls, and overall dark theme.Google Fonts: The Space Mono font for a retro-futuristic look.üèóÔ∏è Project Structure & Key ClassesAll code is contained within the <script> tag in the single HTML file, organized into classes for modularity:ClassDescriptionVectorHandles all 2D vector mathematics (addition, scaling, magnitude) necessary for the physics engine.EntityThe base class for all moving game objects, managing position, velocity, and boundary wrapping.ShipExtends Entity. Adds rotation, thrust logic, and custom drawing to represent the player's spacecraft.AsteroidExtends Entity. Represents the obstacles with random initial velocity.GameThe main game controller. Manages game state (menu, playing, gameover), input handling, the main update loop (fixed timestep), collision detection, and score tracking.
